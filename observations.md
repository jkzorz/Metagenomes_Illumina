## Mapping

Samples that are same depth (i.e. 0-4cm) have much higher mapping percentage than samples from same core but different depths. 

E.g. 

The hole (2A-1) 0-4 cm vs The hole (2A-1) 12-16 cm: 5.5% of reads mapped

The hole (2A-1) 0-4 cm vs Purple haze (2A-2) 0-4 cm: 35% of reads mapped. 

The hole and purple haze were ~ 1 km apart. Therefore it seems that samples that are the same depth but 1 km apart are more similar than samples that are 8 cm different in depth but in the exact same location
