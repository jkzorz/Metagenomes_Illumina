# Assembly


Comparative review on metagenome assembly: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169662

### Megahit 
- Better for microdiversity 
- Faster/less RAM
- Produces shorter contigs
- Might struggle with larger datasets in assembling abundant species
- biased towards relatively low coverage genomes
- "divide and conquer" approach might be best option for large datasets? 


### MetaSpades
- Produces longer contigs
- Captures high diversity even at high complexity and low read coverage
- Takes much more memory and time
